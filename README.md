# File Handling and Error Handling in Python

## 📄 Description

This Python script demonstrates basic **file handling** and **error handling** techniques using a simple example:

- It creates and writes data to a file.
- It reads from the file and modifies its content.
- It includes error handling to manage cases where the file cannot be found or read.

## 📌 Features

### ✅ File Handling
- **Write** a string (`"Michelle, Margaret"`) to a file named `names.pdf` in the `WEEK 4/ASSIGNMENT` directory.
- **Read** the file content.
- **Replace** the name `"Michelle"` with `"Nana"` in the file.
- **Overwrite** the file with the modified content.

### ⚠️ Error Handling
- Prompts the user to enter a filename.
- Attempts to open and read the file.
- Displays:
  - `"The file does not exist. Please check the file path."` if the file isn't found.
  - `"File cannot be read. Please try again."` if there's an I/O error during reading.
